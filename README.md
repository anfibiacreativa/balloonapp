# YOUR FUN RIDE TO INTEGRATING ANGULAR TOOLS AND EMBRACING THE JAM STACK
## Wintech World Series Online Festival Workshop

JAM is the achronym for Javascript, API's and Markup, so as you probably guessed,
those are the ingredients of this stack.

The JAM Stack also introduces a set of best practices,  like, "everything lives in GIT", 
"deployments should be atomic", "assets are requested from CDN", and "pages
should be pre-rendered". JAM Stack sites are fast and performant, and Open Source tools
help us build them real quick, too!
